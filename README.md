# Welcome to the Community Podcast App!

Do you love listening to podcasts but find that existing apps on the App Store don't quite meet your needs? Look no further!

**Community Podcast** is an open-source project created to build the best podcast app on the market, and we need your help to make it happen. Our goal is to collaboratively develop an app that truly caters to podcast enthusiasts like us. Once completed, it will be published on the App Store. If you're excited about contributing to a project where your work will be recognized and published, you're in the right place!

We believe in creating an app by the community, for the community. No corporate agendas hereâ€”just pure, collaborative innovation. Everything about this app is flexible and open to your ideas.

## Features
- **Podcast Discovery**: Uses the PodcastIndex API to find random podcasts for the HomeView.
- **Podcast Search**: Integrates with the iTunes API for searching specific podcasts.
- **Language Learning (TBD)**: Designed to help users learn new languages through podcasts. The app analyzes your strengths and weaknesses using AI, suggests relevant episodes, and provides transcripts to aid comprehension. Quick tests are also included to track your progress and knowledge.

I created this podcast app to apply my Swift knowledge and develop a fantastic tool for fellow podcast lovers. There's still plenty to do, and your contributions are welcome!
