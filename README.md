# Podcast

This podcast app uses the PodcastIndex API to get random podcasts to seed the HomeView, and the iTunes API to search for specific podcasts. My primary goal was to create a language learning app that takes full advantage of podcasts, using AI to analyze your strengths and weaknesses in the desired language, and then suggest relevant podcasts or episodes that help with learning. It also provides transcripts of episodes, so that users can easily catch up if they have difficulty recognizing words. Additionally, it could include quick tests to track progress and knowledge of the language or languages being learned.

I created this podcast app to apply what I had learned in Swift and to make a fantastic podcast app since I'm a big fan of listening to podcasts. There are still plenty of things to do, such as the SwiftUI header view, which I haven't yet done anything with. My idea was to make an interactive header view that uses AI to suggest podcasts based on user preferences and to show the amount of time spent listening to podcasts and progress in learning the desired language.

The app should be hooked up to Firebase to provide access from all devices. I open-sourced this app and my ideas so that many people can benefit and build a good community.
